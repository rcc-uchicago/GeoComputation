# GeoComputation
Introduction to HPC for GeoComputation: 
This workshop will introduce attendees to performing Geocomputation analysis using a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. Methods for parallel computing will be presented in the context of geospatial analysis. Participants will be introduced to geospatial tools available on the midway cluster. Most of the hands-on training could be done on any operating system; however, some parts of the hands-on will be demonstrated using the Midway2 cluster.

Objectives:

(i) introduction to single-threaded and multithreaded geospatial tools such as GDAL/OGR, arcpy, and simple features (sf), raster, and stars packages in R.

(ii) implicit and explicit parallelization

(iii) introduction to Slurm

(iv) writing simple Bash scripts for raster and vector processing


Duration: 2 hours

Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Geographic Information Systems and previous experience of working with the command line is assumed.
